- description: Patientenlifter or person lifters are assistive devices that aim to
    minimize physical effort when lifting and transferring people who need care. They
    come in a variety of types, such as mobile or stationary lifters with or without
    electric drives, and their primary purpose is to make caring for movement-restricted
    individuals easier.
  funding: There are several ways to fund the purchase of a patient or person lifter.
    Depending on your location, you may be able to access grants or subsidies to help
    cover the cost of a patient lifter. Additionally, many insurance providers may
    cover the cost of a patient lifter if it is deemed medically necessary. Lastly,
    some providers offer payment plans or financing options to help make the purchase
    of a patient lifter more affordable.

  use_cases: Patient or personnel lifters are aids that are designed to minimize physical
    effort when lifting and transferring bedridden people. They are particularly suitable
    for transferring people who are no longer able to stand up on their own due to
    various reasons, such as muscle diseases, (degenerative) joint diseases, walking
    disabilities, paralysis, Parkinson's disease, or multi-morbid diseases. They are
    also used when other lifting and transferring aids are no longer providing satisfactory
    support, such as for transferring people who are very tall or heavy.
